# Zenify

## Introduction
Zenify is a website designed to cater to the needs of our customers interested in the betterment of their mental and physical well-being. I designed this website in order to provide users with the ability to browse for various yoga methodologies and select from a variety of experienced tutors. The ultimate aim of Zenify is to promote mind-body wellness and health and foster a community of like minded yoga enthusiasts.

## User experience 
### User Stories 
- The end user is someone who is interested in learning body/mind self-improvement techniques. They want a website that will provide them with techniques, lessons and supporting material to excel in their yoga journey. A user will want a method for easily signing up to their services, the ability to browse the options they have with regards to different yoga techniques and yoga teachers. 
- As the site owner my goal is to ensure I have an attractive user experience on my site that enables seemless transition through its pages for our users. I want to ensure I am providing valuable and accurate information in a user friendly way that maximises user utility. 

## Design
### Color Scheme
I opted for calming background colors such as white, blue and darker purples to instil a sense of calm and contrast with the text on the screen.
### Typography
I opted for using the font 'Roboto' for its modern appearance and clean design as well as its professional look for the site.
### Imagery
I decided to provide a simple image experience on the website with a clear and large main image on the home page to highlight the websites function plus three clear pictures of our instructors. The aim was to not overwhelm users with pictures and images.
