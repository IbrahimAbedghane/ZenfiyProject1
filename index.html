            <h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
            <p>Vinyasa stands in opposition to hatha. Hatha classes focus on one pose at a time, with rest in between.2 In contrast, flow classes string poses together to make a sequence. Due to vinyasa's more active nature, you should ideally be wearing clothes that move with you in lightweight, sweat-wicking materialâ€”Gymshark's Elevate Collection is a good option. A sports bra for yoga will also provide the right amount of support to carry you through flow of your poses.</p>
            <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Research shows that vinyasa yoga reduces arterial stiffness that occurs with age, a significant factor in improving heart health and reducing risks of high blood pressure.</li>
                <li>Vinyasa yoga has also been shown to improve positive emotional ratings over negative ones.</li>
                <li>Vinyasa yoga is excellent for your health. Not only does it keep you active, but it reduces stress, is accessible for many fitness levels, and improves heart health.</li>
