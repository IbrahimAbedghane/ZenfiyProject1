            <h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
            <p>Vinyasa which is a type of "flow" yoga, string poses together to make a sequence. Due to vinyasa's more active nature, you should ideally be wearing clothes that move with you in lightweight. A sports bra for yoga will also provide the right amount of support to carry you through the flow of your poses.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Health Benefits and how to perform</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Research shows that vinyasa yoga reduces arterial stiffness that occurs with age, a significant factor in improving heart health and reducing risks of high blood pressure.</li>
                <li>Vinyasa yoga has also been shown to improve positive emotional ratings over negative ones.</li>
                <li>Vinyasa yoga is excellent for your health. Not only does it keep you active, but it reduces stress, is accessible for many fitness levels, and improves heart health.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How to perform Vinyasa movements?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look towards the top of your mat and keep your gaze forward. Shift your weight forward so your shoulders surpass your wrists.</li>
                <li>Maintain your plank shape (open chest, engaged core, active legs) as you bend your elbows straight back and lower your body in one straight line, halfway.</li>
                <li>Hug your elbows in toward your ribs to hover just for a beat.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hatha Yoga</h2>
            <p>A yoga class described as ‘Hatha’ will typically involve a set of physical postures (yoga poses) and breathing techniques. These are typically practised more slowly and with more static holds than a Vinyasa flow or Ashtanga class.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved flexibility, especially of the hamstrings, hips, and shoulders.</li>
                <li>Improves muscle strength and tone with better posture and body awareness.</li>
                <li>Reduces stress and anxiety and improves sleep quality and your ability to relax.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How do we perform Hatha movements?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Kneel on the floor and grab your elbows with your opposite hands.</li>
            <li>Place your forearms on the floor. Rest the back of your head in between your hands. Your hands should form a crown around your head.</li>
            <li>Keeping the balls of your feet on the floor, straighten your knees to raise them off of the floor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Kundalini Yoga</h2>
            <p>Kundalini yoga is a form of yoga that involves chanting, singing, breathing exercises, and repetitive poses.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In a small 2017 study, participants experienced immediate stress relief after doing Kundalini yoga. This effect continued after they practiced for 3 more months.</li>
                <li>In a 2017 controlled trial, researchers studied 81 participants with mild cognitive impairment. The participants were randomly divided into two groups. One group practiced Kundalini yoga, while the other group received memory enhancement training for 12 weeks.</li>
                <li>Another small 2017 study found that Kundalini yoga may improve body positivity and self-acceptance. These benefits were observed in nine women diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>How to perform Kundalini movements?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Stand straight on the floor. Bring both your arms in front of the chest and join the palms in a prayer position.</li>
            <li>Keeping the palms joined, stretch both your arms upwards. Bend your right knee and place the sole of your right foot on the interior side of the left thigh.</li>
            <li>Keep your left leg straight and hold the position as long as you can. Relax for a minute and do it on the other side with the left foot. Repeat 5 times.</li>
            </ul>
