    <section class="vinyasa-yoga">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
            <p>Vinyasa stands in opposition to hatha. Hatha classes focus on one pose at a time, with rest in between.2 In contrast, flow classes string poses together to make a sequence. Due to vinyasa's more active nature, you should ideally be wearing clothes that move with you in lightweight, sweat-wicking material—Gymshark's Elevate Collection is a good option. A sports bra for yoga will also provide the right amount of support to carry you through flow of your poses.</p>
            <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Research shows that vinyasa yoga reduces arterial stiffness that occurs with age, a significant factor in improving heart health and reducing risks of high blood pressure.</li>
                <li>Vinyasa yoga has also been shown to improve positive emotional ratings over negative ones.</li>
                <li>Vinyasa yoga is excellent for your health. Not only does it keep you active, but it reduces stress, is accessible for many fitness levels, and improves heart health.</li>
            </ul>

    <section class="hatha-yoga">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Hatha Yoga</h2>
            <p>A yoga class described as ‘Hatha’ will typically involve a set of physical postures (yoga poses) and breathing techniques. These are typically practised more slowly and with more static holds than a Vinyasa flow or Ashtanga class.</p>
            <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved flexibility, especially of the hamstrings, hips, and shoulders.</li>
                <li>Improves muscle strength and tone with better posture and body awareness.</li>
                <li>Reduces stress and anxiety and improves sleep quality and your ability to relax.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <section class="kundalini-yoga">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Kundalini Yoga</h2>
            <p>Kundalini yoga is a form of yoga that involves chanting, singing, breathing exercises, and repetitive poses.</p>
            <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In a small 2017 studyTrusted Source, participants experienced immediate stress relief after doing Kundalini yoga. This effect continued after they practiced for 3 more months.</li>
                <li>In a 2017 controlled trialTrusted Source, researchers studied 81 participants with mild cognitive impairment. The participants were randomly divided into two groups. One group practiced Kundalini yoga, while the other group received memory enhancement training for 12 weeks.</li>
                <li>Another small 2017 study found that Kundalini yoga may improve body positivity and self-acceptance. These benefits were observed in nine women diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.</li>
            </ul>
